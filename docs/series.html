Huh?","In the alley next to the shopping street is a Japanese izakaya-style pub…","Thank you.","…that has an unsettling name on its shop curtain.","However, those who have the courage to enter will come to realize","that this place has good drinks and good food.","-And the company of warm-hearted people. -Welcome.","Welcome.","Have a seat at the counter.","-Please come in. -Just a moment.","I'll take your coat.","My father who used to own this pub would often say…","We serve food that can be found in any household,","We serve food that can be found in any household, and that in itself makes us a rip-off, a bottakuri.","But Mine, even though they may be common recipes,","cook every single dish with all your heart.","A dish that unexpectedly brings smiles to people's faces…","Once you can make that,","our customers will not regret the money they spend.","But I haven't reached that point yet.","That's why Bottakuri is the right name for this place.","Mine-bo, pour me your best sake!","Welcome, Toku.","Welcome. Have a seat at the counter.","Hey now, don't come in throwing fists. Did something happen at work?","Huh? Don't give me that. You really look like you could blow off some stream.","Don't give me that. You really look like you could blow off some stream.","Well then, true to our Bottakuri namesake, I shall get you the most expensive drink…","Is what I would like to say but…","Why do you have to say it like that, Mine-bo?","I believe a different drink will pair better with today's special.","Oh, it's oden.","It got cold all of a sudden again so that sounds good.","Yes, I'll have the hot oden please.","-Sure. -Me, too.","Yes. What are you drinking?","I'll leave it up to you.","Okay.","Here it is.","-Here is your oden. -Whoa.","Oh wow, it looks so good. Wow.","Okay then, let's dig in.","Hey, Toku. What about our toast?","But this plump daikon radish is just begging me to eat it.","Let me have one bite.","Thank you very much.","This bastard took a sip.","And here I was waiting for you!","I'm sorry, Shin!","This old man can't be helped.","This sake is…","Do you know what it is?","Yes…","It has a proper aroma of rice but the taste is light.","And it has a mature flavor as well as a refreshing aftertaste.","Yeah.","Oh? Has Shin won again?","We don't know yet.","Let it go, Sis. You can't beat Shinzo.","I've been drinking sake since years before Mine-bo was born.","Of course I know a lot of things.","That may be true, but…","Let the old man have his glory.","So Shin, what is it?","I've got to say it's Suwaizumi.","Right? Moreover, considering this mild flavor which enriches the taste of the dishes…","Moreover, considering this mild flavor which enriches the taste of the dishes…","I'd say it's Mantensei.","How did I do?","You got it right.","You're amazing.","It is from the Suwa sake brewer in Tottori Prefecture.","-Yes, this! Mantensei. -How did you know?","-Hm? -It's our first time serving it.","I know, but you can generally tell by the color.","Flavor, aroma and color are the three things to go by.","Flavor, aroma and color are the three things to go by. -First of all, look here. At this color. -It is different.","-First of all, look here. At this color. -It is different.","-Color? -Look.","Oh, it's yellow.","This is the true color of sake.","Is that so?","In the case of sake, it's called yamabuki-iro.","Really? Yamabuki-iro?","Isn't that a stronger yellow tone?","Yeah. I thought the same thing so I looked it up.","The closest color was called mitsudasou.","Mitsudasou? I've never heard of it.","That's probably why by it's called by the recognized color, yamabuki-iro.","It's just like you to do something as tedious as look up color charts--","Shut it. It's normal to look things up if you're interested in them.","Yeah, sure. I learned something thanks to you.","I was just kidding.","I got a glimpse of the label.","How sneaky of you. That's cheating.","Your defense is weak, Mine-bo.","It's a draw then.","Either way, this oden is delicious.","Huh?","Mine-bo. Do you have that thing?","What thing?","Don't be so mean. I'm talking about misozuke.","You have a sharp eye.","I was planning on making it tomorrow's special.","Tomorrow, huh? But I have plans and can't come tomorrow.","Come on and let me have it today. I want to get some energy.","What's the big deal? It seems Toku had a rough day, right?","Let him have it.","It might not be ready yet…","Fine. I'll treat you to it.","That's the spirit.","-Please wait. -I will.","-Here you go. -Oh! -This is it. -Egg yolk misozuke.","-This is it. -Egg yolk misozuke.","Th-That looks good.","What? You can't resist it, either?","And another one jumps the gun!","Sorry.","-One for Shinzo. -Thank you.","-I'll order another drink as thanks. -Oh!","Shall we go for a hot sake next?","That will be nice. Chilled sake for oden and hot sake for this.","Chilled sake for oden and hot sake for this.","You gotta problem?","Thanks.","It may be a bit soon, but it's rich and delicious.","By the way Toku…","Huh?","Why do you need to blow off steam?","Oh that… A lot happened at work today and we couldn't finish the job.","A lot happened at work today and we couldn't finish the job.","That's unusual for you. What happened?","The teko didn't come.","-Oh? -Teko?","It's what we call an apprentice.","Right.","At Toku's workplace,","they do things like carry materials and gather tools, right?","Yes, that's right.","The new apprentice skipped work without permission.","-Oh. -Here's your beer.","Was he sick?","I wish that had been the case.","-He said he was fed up. -What?","Said he woke up, and just felt fed up with carrying poles and wood all day long.","It came out of nowhere.","-So he skipped work? -Yeah.","Hey now, that's not acceptable.","He didn't seem like that kind of kid…","You must have had a hard day, Toku.","Yeah. The site supervisor was furious.","I did double my usual workload.","And tomorrow, I have to deal with a complaint at a construction site,","then take down a house site after that.","So tomorrow will be tough too!","It really will be.","Kaoru, give me another.","Toku.","It'll affect you tomorrow so let's call it a day.","Oh, does that mean the egg yolk misozuke wasn't the only giveaway?","Daikon radish do come with leaves, after all.","Here you go.","Such a brilliant green.","This will give me energy.","It's still cold outside but this brings a spring feel, doesn't it?","Oden ends winter, and rice with greens brings spring.","A rather refined matchmaking.","Yeah, well said.","Then this egg yolk misozuke…","is our matchmaker for the full moon of spring.","-Nice one. -Wow!","Hello.","-Thank you, please come again! -Okay!","Hello.","-Hey, Mine-bo. -Oh!","How was yesterday's daikon radish?","It was really juicy and tasty.","Right? It's the good stuff.","Today's special is kakina.","-Looks delicious. -They're great today.","I'll take it.","Yeah? I can deliver it.","-It's okay, I'll buy it now. -Okay.","I'll have one more. -Two then. -Yup.","Thank you.","Here we go.","Ume, here is kakina ohitashi and your usual shochu with hot water.","Yes.","I'll put two here. Thank you for this.","This kakina ohitashi is made with wasabi and not karashi mustard.","Yes! A change in spice is nice, isn't it?","I made it.","Well done, Kaoru.","-I'm heading out. -Bye now.","Thank you very much. -Please come again. -Okay.","-Welcome. -Toku!","Ume-ba, you're here.","Do you have good news? You're in a great mood.","I thought you couldn't come.","-Sorry for the trouble. -Not at all.","It went well at work and I wanted to tell you about it.","-I'll take your jacket. -Thanks.","-The sake from yesterday and misozuke. -Yes.","Sure.","My apprentice came to the work site first thing in the morning.","-The one that bailed on work? -Yeah.","-The one that bailed on work? -Yeah. Bracing for the possibility we'd never be hired again,","Bracing for the possibility we'd never be hired again,","we went to apologize to the supervisor.","And he says, \"'I don't want to work with you ever again', is what I want to say,","but you always do such a good job so I will let it go this time.\"","-That's great news. -Yes.","But why did he change his mind? He was angry yesterday, right?","Apparently he calmed down and thought it over.","The supervisor said he himself was reckless and a mess as a young man.","But he's working properly now.","So he said he needs to be patient with young ones, too.","I'm glad to hear that.","Is your apprentice off the hook?","Nope.","But, he's got a… What do you call it? A penalty stroke?","If he does anything again, I'll fire that guy.","Did he work properly today?","Yeah, just like usual. The same way he did before bailing.","What? He wasn't sorry at all?","Well, I don't know if he was sorry or not.","Oh boy, the young ones these day.","Oh boy, the young ones these day. Yes…","-Apparently they are like that nowadays. -Are they?","They suddenly get fed up and walk out then come back like nothing happened.","But he could at least act like he's sorry.","Maybe it's something similar to this.","Huh?","What do you mean?","This misozuke is made by simply placing the egg yolk in miso,","but it's quite difficult.","You have to very careful or the yolk will break in the miso.","This will ruin the miso bed.","-It's well-cured. -Yeah.","Yes, it is. Egg yolk is difficult to handle.","But if you place it in a miso bed, it will gradually thicken","and become even more tasty.","It's cured just right.","Oh, delicious! It's full of umami.","This creamy texture is so good.","It has matured, making it even richer in taste.","Oh, I see.","Is that what you are implying?","Place young ones who are difficult to handle","in a miso bed and they will turn out okay.","Ume. Saying they'll turn out okay is a bit harsh.","Egg yolk is tasty to start with and is also full of nutrition.","Silly me, that's right.","But we can't serve egg yolk as it is and expect people to pay for it.","Even though this place is named Bottakuri, that would be too much of a rip-off.","I see.","You take something that's already tasty, and refine it to make a different flavor.","Then it will become a dish you can serve to your customers.","Yes.","That's true.","The same may be true when it comes to teaching young people today.","To make a tasty misozuke you need to take your time and watch over it,","and take good care of the miso bed as well, right?","If you are a good miso bed as a boss the egg yolk will turn out delicious.","You need salt to taste good but too much will make it too salty to eat.","Being a boss sure is difficult!","So I need to wait to temper them until the yolk thickens.","I should be careful not to break the yolk so I don't ruin the miso bed either.","Well then,","shall we toast to Toku's apprentice hopefully becoming delicious misozuke?","What? Ume, they are not misozuke.","Ume, they are not misozuke.","Oh, so sorry! My mistake.","Not misozuke but a fine workman.","Come on, Ume-ba.","What's today's special?","How about deep-fried pond smelt? It will go well with sake.","I'll have that.","Yes.","My father who used to own this pub would often say…","Mine.","We serve food that can be found in any household,","and that in itself makes us a rip-off, a bottakuri.","But Mine, even though they may be common recipes,","cook every single dish with all your heart.","A dish that unexpectedly brings smiles to people's faces…","Once you can make that,","our customers will not regret the money they spend.","But I haven't reached that point yet.","That's why Bottakuri is the right name for this place.","Here you are.","Thank you.","-Here. -Amazing.","-Let's eat. -Looks good.","Let's dig in.","This tastes marvelous.","It's delicious, Mine-bo.","I'm glad.","It's amazing.","It's good.","Tasty, isn't it?","Kaoru's making it next time.","No, I won't.","-But you've tasted it. -No way.","Thank you, see ya.","Thank you.","-Take care. -Will do.","Izakaya Bottakuri.","This place with the unsettling name has good drinks and good food,","as well as a warmth and dedication that's hard to come by nowadays.","Tonight's liquor.","Suwaizumi's premium pure rice wine, Mantensei.","It's a sake with well-rounded umami.","When combined with a rich dish, the flavorful tastes will melt together","creating a delicious harmony. MADE IN TOTTORI PREFECTURE","Today's piece of advice is… egg yolk misozuke.","Lay out a bed of seasoned miso and place a cheesecloth on top of it.","Make indentions with the back of a spoon.","Then take your separated egg yolks,","and gently place them in the indentations so they will not break.","Place a cheesecloth with miso on top, cover it all with a lid and you're done!","You can enjoy it from the next day, but try your preferred length of curing.","With this, you too can be a rip-off.","Let me have carrot leaves next time.","What are you making?","Here.","So this is what heating sake does…","On the next Izakaya Bottakuri,","episode two, \"Tag of Memories.\"","I'll make sure to rip you off.","Don't miss it!

Even with this background, if ramen and ramen restaurants themselves were not appealing, they would not have been accepted in New York City, where there are many restaurants and eateries. One of the possible reasons is the overwhelming flavor of the “pork bone soup. Soup made from cooked pork bones is rich in inosinic acid. The addition of a sauce containing glutamic acid from kelp and guanylic acid from shiitake mushrooms creates a synergistic effect of umami. Umami is the greatest advantage of Japanese cuisine, and it is something that is difficult to imitate in other cuisines. In fact, many of the Japanese ramen chains that have expanded overseas, including the aforementioned”IPPUDO,” are pork-based ramen restaurants. In areas where pork bone broth cannot be served for religious or other reasons, many restaurants use a soup called “toripaitan,” in which chicken is boiled until it becomes cloudy. Although there are now an increasing number of ramen stores that serve soup that is not cloudy, the influence of “cloudy soups” such as pork bone soup and chicken white soup on the timing of breakthroughs is not small. Pork bone soup, as the name implies, is made by boiling pork bones and emulsifying them into a cloudy white emulsion. This is a soup that cannot be found in any other dish, and it is not easy to find a dish in which more than 300 cc of soup is served per serving. For this reason, ramen was initially recognized in the United States and Europe as a soup dish rather than a noodle dish. In Japan, the noodles are sometimes eaten in their entirety and the soup is left behind, whereas in the West, the soup is sometimes drunk in its entirety and the noodles are left behind. In the past, most ramen restaurants in other countries have imitated Japanese ramen or Japanese ramen restaurants have expanded into other countries, but recently, original ramen restaurants in those countries have been created. Like the local ramen of other parts of Japan, we can expect to see a rapid increase in the number of unique ramen restaurants that are rooted in the culture and dietary habits of the country in which they are located.\n\n\n\n"]},"columns":[{"accessor":"Script","name":"Script","type":"character","cell":[{"name":"Fragment","attribs":[],"children":[{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"fontSize":20,"fontWeight":300,"color":"#202020","fontFamily":"Yomogi"}},"children":["豚骨ラーメンが世界を制した理由とは そのような背景がありつつも、やはりラーメンやラーメン店自体に魅力がなければ、飲食店が多いニューヨークの街で受け入れられることはなかっただろう。その魅力の一つとして考えられるのは「豚骨スープ」が持つ圧倒的な旨味だ。 豚の骨を炊いたスープはイノシン酸を豊富に含んでいる。そこに昆布などのグルタミン酸やシイタケなどのグアニル酸を含んだタレを加えることで、旨味の相乗効果が生まれる。旨味こそ日本食最大のアドバンテージであり、他の料理ではなかなかまねのできないことだ。 実際、前述した『IPPUDO』をはじめ、海外に進出している日本のラーメンチェーンの多くは豚骨ラーメン店である。また、宗教上などの理由で豚骨スープを出せないエリアでは鶏を白濁するまで煮込んだ「鶏白湯（とりぱいたん）」と呼ばれるスープで提供している店が多い。今でこそ白濁していないスープを出すラーメン店も増えているが、ブレイクスルーするタイミングで豚骨スープや鶏白湯などの「白濁スープ」が与えた影響は少なくないと考えられる。 豚骨スープとは、その名の通り豚の骨を煮込んで白濁乳化させたものだ。これは他の料理には見られないスープであり、しかも一杯あたり300cc以上もの量が提供されるような料理はなかなかない。そのため当初米国や欧州では、ラーメンは麺料理というよりもスープ料理として認知されていた。日本では麺は全て食べてスープを残すことがあるが、欧米ではスープは全て飲み干されて麺が残されることもある。 これまで海外では日本のラーメンを模倣したり、日本のラーメン店が進出したりするケースがほとんどであったが、最近では、その国オリジナルのラーメン店も生まれている。日本各地のご当地ラーメンのように、その国の文化や食生活に根付いた、その国ならではの個性豊かなラーメンが、今後急速に増えていくことだろう。"]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"fontSize":2}},"children":["."]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"fontSize":2}},"children":["."]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"fontSize":2}},"children":["."]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"fontSize":2}},"children":["."]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"fontSize":2}},"children":["."]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"fontSize":2}},"children":["."]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"fontSize":12,"fontWeight":300,"color":"#202020","fontFamily":"Klee One"}},"children":["What is the reason why Tonkotsu Ramen has conquered the world?
