Concept,Information
Brain,.
Pituitary gland,Releases hormones into blood. Controls growth and body development.
Hypothalamus,"Brain part. Regulates, sleep, hunger and body temperature."
Thalamus,Relays sensory signals from body to cerebrum.
Brain stem,Connected to spinal cord. Links the brain to the rest of the body. Controls heartbeat and breathing.
Cerebrum,"Controls all conscious actions and thoughts, analyzes sensory data and stores memories."
Cerebellum,Complex folded structure. Controls balance and movement.
Cerebrum,.
2 hemisphere,Left and right hemisphere.
Left hemisphere,"Language, scientific thought, rational thought, mathematical skills, writing skills,  verbal skills."
Right hemisphere,"Spatial skills, art, imagination, insight, music, creative thoughts, emotion."
4 lobes,"Frontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe."
Frontal lobe,"Thought, speech, personality and emotion"
Temporal lobe,Sound recognition.
Parietal lobe,"Process information from the senses especially from skin, muscle and joints."
Occipital lobe,Received nerve signal from the eye. Interprets visual information.
Brain mapping,.
Prefrontal cortex,"Associated with personality, thinking and awareness."
Broca’s area,Controls speech and word formation.
Premotor cortex,"Initiates, guides and coordinates action."
Motor cortex,Controls coordinated muscle movement.
Somatic sensory cortex,"Analyzes nerve signals from skim, muscles and joints."
Sensory association cortex,Coordinates information from all senses.
Visual association cortex,Analyzes visual data to form mental images.
Wernicke’s area,Interprets written and spoken language.
Primary visual cortex,Receives visual data from the eyes.
Auditory association cortex,"Associates sound signals with memories, emotions and other senses."
Primary auditory cortex,Analyzes nerve signals from the ear.
Memory concept,.
Making memories,Memories are formed by electrical signals making connections between nerve cells so that they form a network. Often activated network creates a long term memory.
Sensory memory,Memory from our senses. Last for a few secs.
Short term memory,Prefrontal cortex. Lost after around 20 secs. Limited capacity.
Long term memory,Often activated nerve cell network creates a long term memory. Lasts for months or several number of years.
Recall,A measure of memory in which the person must retrieve information learned earlier. 
Recognition,A measure of memory in which the person need only identify items previously learned.
Involuntary recall,The brain retrieves a memory by itself. Trigger especially by smelling. Sounds and sight can be also a trigger.
Recording a new memory,Takes place in the temporal lobe.
"Relearning, Rehearsal",Review or relearning previously learned information.
Memories,.
Unconscious and emotional memory,Stored in amygdala.
Spatial memory,Stored in hippocampus. Parietal lobe.
Procedural memory,Stored in putamen. Learned skills and procedures
Episodic memory,Stored in cortex. Memories of personal and life events
Semantic memory,Stored in temporal lobe. Learned facts and details
Encoding,.
Visual encoding,Perceiving visual objects. Encode visual information.
Acoustic encoding,Hearing sounds. Encoding audio information.
Tactile encoding,Encoding information perceive through sense of touch.
Kinesthetic encoding,Joint and muscle sensor. Receptors in the joints detect their movement. Position of limbs are being monitor to correct balance. Muscles sensors detects the stretching and contracting of muscles as well as the forces that are acting on it. Somatic sensory cortex. 
Other Sensory encoding,Smelling scents. Tasting flavors. Olfactory receptors detects scent. Olfactory bulb gathers scent signals and passes them to the brain. Taste buds detect the taste.
Semantic encoding,Encoding sensory input that has a particular meaning or context. Facts and details.
Complex encoding,Combinations of encoding techniques.
Processing,.
Shallow processing,"Encoding information on basic level. Auditory or visual level. Based on the sound, structure or appearance of a word + low level encapsulation."
Deep processing,Encodes semantically based on the actual meaning of the word or combination of encoding techniques + high level encapsulation.
Memorization techniques,.
Mnemonics,"Memory aids. Use vivid imagery and organizational devices. Acronym, rhymes, musical, acrostics, imagery."
Chunking,Organizing items into familiar manageable units.
Trip method,Shopping list. Checklist.
Association,"Associate, link, connect or attribute an info from other information."
Space repetition,"Review learned information in a specified time frame.  Ex. After an hour then after a day then after a week then after a month then after 3 months."
Mind maps,Creative and effective note taking. Offers an overview of topic and complex information in a visual form.
Learning techniques,.
Remembering,"Recall facts and basic concept. Define, duplicate, list, memorize, repeat, state."
Understanding,"Explain ideas or concept. Classify, describe, discuss, explain, identify, locate, recognize, report, select, translate."
Applying,"Use information in new situation. Execute, implement, solve, use, demonstrate, interpret, operate, schedule, sketch."
Analyzing,"Draw connections among ideas. Differentiate, organize, relate, compare, contrast, distinguish, examine, experiment, question."
Evaluating,"Justify a stand or decision. Appraise, argue, defend, judge, select, support, value, critique, weigh."
Creating,"Produce new or original work. Design, assemble, construct, conjecture, develop, formulate."
Speaking,.
Having a voice,Holding a conversation depends on both the organs of speech and mental processing.
Lips,Change shape to alter sounds.
Tongue,Changes shape and position to modify word sounds.
Vocal chords,Sheets of fibrous tissue that open and close to alter sound and pitch.
Broca’s area,Controls speech production.
Auditory area,Analyzes speech sounds and tone of voice.
Visual area,Analyzes nerve impulses from the eyes.
Wernicke’s area,Interprets from both visual and audio areas.
Motor area,Sends signals to muscles that produce speech
Language learning,.
Input,Reading. Listening.
Output,Speaking. Writing.
Reading,Silent reading (read through the eyes without speaking). Read aloud (read through the eyes while speaking).
Listening,Listening to audio files. Listening to video files (able to see what is being depicted in the video).
Speaking,Speaking while at the materials being read. Speaking your thoughts.
Writing,Writing and copying the reference material. Writing characters and sentences from your thoughts.
Stacking up inputs,With reading and listening the information are being encoded into the brain in multiple ways which can create memory traces. In order to create more neuron connections you can apply memorization and learning techniques and thus strengthen this traces or memories.
Outputting,Speaking and writing are skills or abilities which needs to be practice in order to create procedural memories. It does also add another layer of encoding information to our brain which improve kinesthetics or reflexes.
Making mistakes,Making a mistake is considered to be a personal life event which a memory can be formed out it.
